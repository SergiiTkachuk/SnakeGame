# SnakeGame

I added a visual style to the game and added the functions: Score, Speed ​​(Level) and Border (Border). The game scores points for each "apple eaten" by the snake. You can also increase the speed of the game and add or remove a boundary where the snake cannot cross to the other side, making the game more difficult.

In the comments you can see the development of the game from the very beginning.
